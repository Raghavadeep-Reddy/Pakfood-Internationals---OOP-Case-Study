Converting a problem statement into class diagram.
## Problem Statement

### The tasks to be performed are:
1.	Extract the main objects (entities) for above system.
2.	Find the necessary attributes and functions that need to be associated with each object (You are required to mention at most three attributes and one functions for a class).
3.	Identify the relationships between these objects.
4.	Construct a final comprehensive Class diagram showing all objects and their relationships along with their attributes and functions.

### Important things to consider:
1.	As happens in real world that everyone visualizes a problem in a different way so the solutions of all students may vary based upon their own thinking, not taken from any source.
2.	You have to use standard UML notations for objects, classes, and their associations.

### Note:
Besides problem statement; objects, properties, and functions of a system can also be extracted from domain knowledge. You have to use all concepts studied so far like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, association, generalization, and specialization wherever applicable.
